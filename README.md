# write a readme or docs so that frontend and backend team are clear with the proejct and project structre

Here is a comprehensive README and docs outline you can use to align your frontend and backend teams clearly on the project scope, architecture, and structure:

# SonicIPChain: Audio Tokenization Decentralized Application (dApp)

## Project Overview

SonicIPChain is a blockchain-based platform where individuals securely store, tokenize, and monetize their audio assets. Leveraging Self Protocol for privacy-first human identity verification, Lighthouse SDK for encrypted IPFS storage, and Flow blockchain for token minting, it empowers creators to license and sell their voice assets based on rich user attributes (age, gender, country, language, accent).

***

## Key Features

- Human identity and attribute verification via Self Protocol on Celo
- Client-side audio encryption and decentralized storage through Lighthouse/IPFS
- Tokenization of encrypted audio on Flow blockchain using Cadence smart contracts
- Segmentation of audio assets based on demographic attributes
- Two dedicated interfaces:
    - **IP Seller Portal:** For users uploading and minting their audio tokens
    - **IP Consumer Portal:** For browsing, filtering, and licensing audio tokens

## Development Workflow

### Team Organization

- **Frontend Team:**
    - Work primarily in `/frontend` directory.
    - Consume Self Protocol APIs for identity verification.
    - Implement UI, routing, wallet connections, and integration with backend APIs and contracts.
- **Backend Team:**
    - Work primarily in `/backend` directory.
    - Develop and deploy Cadence smart contracts on Flow.
    - Implement Self Protocol verification, audio encryption, and IPFS storage workflows.
    - Provide APIs/endpoints or SDKs consumable by frontend.


### Collaboration and Code Integration

- Use Git branches to separate frontend and backend development.
- Create feature branches for individual tasks and open pull requests to respective branches.
- Merge completed features regularly to avoid conflicts.
- Use shared environment variable templates (.env.example) for consistent configuration.
- Communicate changes to APIs and contract interfaces via `/docs/API-Spec.md`.

***

## Getting Started (For Developers)

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies for frontend and backend separately using `npm install` or `yarn`.
2. Setup `.env` files in both `frontend` and `backend`, based on `.env.example` files.
3. Backend team deploys smart contracts to Flow Testnet.
4. Frontend team connects to deployed contracts and Self Protocol endpoints.
5. Run the frontend dev server and backend services concurrently for end-to-end development.

***

## Documentation

- `/docs/API-Spec.md` contains detailed specs of smart contract functions, REST or SDK backend APIs, and data models for tokens, proofs, IPFS hashes, and user attributes.
- README and `/docs` will be regularly updated with integration guidelines and test instructions.

***

## Communication \& Task Tracking

- Use GitHub Issues for bug tracking and feature requests.
- Utilize GitHub Projects or other kanban tools for sprint planning and task assignment.
- Regular team sync meetings to ensure alignment.

***

This README format keeps all team members on the same page about roles, how to contribute, folder structure, and project goals. The `/docs/API-Spec.md` document acts as a contract between frontend and backend for smooth integration.

If needed, I can help prepare a starter `/docs/API-Spec.md` with sample API and contract specs next.
